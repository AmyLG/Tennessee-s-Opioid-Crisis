### Project overview
Opioids are a class of drugs including prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, the synthetic opioid fentanyl, and the illegal drug heroin. These drugs produce euphoria in addition to pain relief, which can lead to dependence, addiction, overdose, and death.

In the late 1990s, opioids began to be prescribed at high rates, which led to widespread misuse and ultimately created a serious national health crisis. In 2019, more than 130 people per day died from opioid-related drug overdoses in the United States. Tennessee has been one of the hardest-hit states in the opioid epidemic, with more than 1300 overdose deaths in 2018.

### Data
In this project, we are working with:

Census data for number of medicare enrollee per state in Tennessee

### Objectives
* Which Tennessee counties had a disproportionately high number of opioid prescriptions?
* Who are the top opioid prescribers for the state of Tennessee?
* What did the trend in overdose deaths due to opioids look like in Tennessee from 2015 to 2018?
* Is there an association between rates of opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths by county?
* Is there any association between a particular type of opioid and number of overdose deaths?
